    "# Week 09 Handson\n",
    "In this week handson, we'll try to play with Kaggle, which is one of the biggest data science community platforms. We will try to join a Kaggle competition by building a model that can predict MoA (Mechanisms of Action) in drugs development. General guide about what you need to do:\n",
    "1. Register to Kaggle (if you haven't had an account yet) with your full name,\n",
    "2. Download the dataset,\n",
    "3. Build a model,\n",
    "4. Perform an inference to the given testing data,\n",
    "5. Submit the inference result\n",
    "\n",
    "Competition link: [cick here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/lish-moa/overview)\n",
    "\n",
    "Submission:\n",
    "1. This jupyter notebook: there are at least three blocks of codes, which are data preparation, modelling and inference. However, you are free to modify, e.g., further breaking down the data prepration block to EDA and data preprocessing, etc.\n",
    "2. Csv file that is submitted to the competition.\n",
    "3. Screenshot of your posisition in the leaderboard (jpg file).\n",
    "\n",
    "Zip those three files above, with a file name of \"W09_your-student-id_your-name.zip\" and submit to the course portal. In case the allowable size is exceeded, you can upload to, e.g., gdrive first, then upload a txt file containing that download url to the course portal. In such case, please make sure that the url is publicly open."
